# Installation

## Steam
Install Skyrim SE from steam. It is ok if it is the latest version because we are going to downgrade it later. Make sure to open skyrim completely then quit. If you are using a non legittimate version, you are going to need to put the installation in your steam directory. Otherwise, wabbajack will not know where you skyrim is installed. 

### Disable Steam Overlay
Steam overlay causes issues with ENB and it is recommended to be turned off. 
* Right click your game in your steam library
* Go to Properties
* Uncheck "Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game"

### Skyrim Updates
Bethesda is still updating this game. When it does it will break all your mods. You want to make sure that steam does not automatically update the game for you. 
* Right Click your game in your steam library
* Go to Properties
* Go to the updates Tab
* Change the drop down to "Only update this game when I launch it"

### Downgrade Skyrim
We are going to need to downgrade Skyrim from AE(Annivarsy edition) to SE(Special Edition). We are using Skyrim version 1.5.97. Download the **FullPatcher.exe** from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57618?tab=files). If you run into any issues with the patcher, please make sure your game is fully up to date on Steam.
