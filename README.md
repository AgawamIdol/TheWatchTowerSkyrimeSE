# Installation

## Steam
Install Skyrim SE from steam. It is ok if it is the latest version because we are going to downgrade it later. Make sure to open skyrim completely then quit. If you are using a non legittimate version, you are going to need to put the installation in your steam directory. Otherwise, wabbajack will not know where you skyrim is installed. 

### Disable Steam Overlay
Steam overlay causes issues with ENB and it is recommended to be turned off. 
* Right click your game in your steam library
* Go to Properties
* Uncheck "Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game"

### Skyrim Updates
Bethesda is still updating this game. When it does it will break all your mods. You want to make sure that steam does not automatically update the game for you. 
* Right Click your game in your steam library
* Go to Properties
* Go to the updates Tab
* Change the drop down to "Only update this game when I launch it"
